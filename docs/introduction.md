## Introduction

### What is a Container?

A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that
includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code,
runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from
each other and the host system, which makes them portable and consistent across
different environments.

### What is Kind?

Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters
using Docker containers as nodes. It is primarily designed for testing
Kubernetes itself, but it can also be used for local development or CI.

### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling,
and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an
application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

#### What Problem Does Kubernetes Solve?

Kubernetes addresses the complexity of managing containerized applications at
scale. It automates the deployment, scaling, and operation of application
containers, ensuring that applications run reliably and efficiently across
different environments.

#### Value Added by Using Kubernetes

By using Kubernetes, you gain the ability to:

- Automatically manage the lifecycle of containers, ensuring high availability
  and fault tolerance.
- Scale applications up or down based on demand.
- Perform rolling updates and rollbacks with minimal downtime.
- Efficiently utilize resources across a cluster of machines.

### What is kubectl?

kubectl is a command-line tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster. It
allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters to deploy applications,
inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.
